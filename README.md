# Module 03 Challenge Project - Password Generator
This program allows the end user to click the "Generate Password" button and 
produce a randomly generated password based on key elements included based on
user response to several prompts.


## Key elements to notice
* Prompt user to enter a value between 8 and 128 characters for the generated
  password length. If an invalid length is supplied, an ALERT message will be
  displayed. A valid length must be supplied or the user can CANCEL the 
  password request.

* Prompt user to include at least one of the following character sets:
    Special Characters - '!#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~'
    Uppercase Characters - 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    Lowercase Characters - 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
    Numbers - '0123456789'

    ALERT message will be displayed if no character set is included via users response 
    from window prompts.
